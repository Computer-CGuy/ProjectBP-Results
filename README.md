# ProjectBP-Results
PBP stands for Project Backpropogation, it edits the image that is inputed to the neuron instead of backpropogating the weights. 
Tweaking the targets will come up with new and interesting images. 
ProjectBP_AlexNet_Hen.ipynb must be renamed ProjectBP_VGG19_Hen.ipynb

Results of my ProjectBP. The code will be released after a Research Paper
